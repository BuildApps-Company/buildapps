						Optimization of the registration of applications for the financial
						platform, which increased the number of clients by 30%
					</H3>
					<p>
						Even if your product is unique, the offer is profitable, and the
						working conditions are impeccable, you risk losing customers anyway.
						The key reasons are a weak technical base, services that do not
						fulfill their tasks, and outdated solutions. Our company helped
						PapaFinance, an online loan service, in this situation.
					</p>
					<H4>
						PapaFinance: the challenges of digitalization of financial services
						that we had to solve.
					</H4>
					<p>
						PapaFinance is an innovative financial platform that provides online
						financing for small businesses and loans up to 3 million rubles.
						After launching the platform and analyzing business processes,
						analysts found that procedures of submitting and processing
						applications are not efficient. Due to this problem, customers leave
						at the registration stage, which means that specialists in online
						loans cannot even get the user's contacts for the successful sale of
						products over the phone or online. The company's management
						approached BuildApps to optimize the customer journey and refine the
						loan platform to improve user experience. After all, the BuildApps
						portfolio already included similar projects, and customers were
						always satisfied with the studio's work, which is vital for
						companies in the digital environment.
					</p>
					<H4>
						Understanding business problems means understanding the main tasks
					</H4>
					<p>
						To solve the main problem of PapaFinance, BuildApps specialists
						analyzed the functioning of the platform and algorithms for
						generating and processing applications, as a result of which they
						formed a key list of tasks:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Simplifying registration of applications for different types of
							loans and financing through the service.
						</li>
						<li>
							Reducing the time for processing an application: from the
							platform's side and in the context of simplifying the routine for
							managers of a financial company.
						</li>
						<li>
							Monitoring the customer journey to successfully obtaining a loan.
						</li>
						<li>
							Automation of obtaining information about the counterparty and its
							financial reliability when deciding to issue a loan.
						</li>
						<li>
							Development of an algorithm for a comprehensive analysis of the
							customer's solvency.
						</li>
						<li>
							Separation of powers of company employees in the system and the
							creation of a single space for working with clients.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						When the specialists began immersing themselves in the business
						tasks of a financial company, the leadership of PapaFinance decided
						to attract more specialists. After all, BuildApps, even at the first
						stage of interaction, was able to show professionalism and a
						responsible attitude to the project, which really convinced the
						customer of the reliability and conscientiousness of this
						contractor. So, the project team has grown from one developer to 6
						people: 4 developers, one technical analyst, and one QA engineer.
					</p>
					<H4>Tasks that flow into technical work</H4>
					<p>
						The project infrastructure consisted of the server, architecture,
						and functional interface based on C#, ASP.NET Core, JS, TS, React,
						MongoDb, PostgreSql, Docker, and Docker compose technologies. Also,
						the customer required integration with the databases of government
						agencies, the National Bureau of Credit Histories, and open
						financial sources. Based on the tasks and technical constraints,
						BuildApps specialists compiled a detailed list of works for the
						successful closure of the project:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							When created in the system, the application goes through several
							stages, including verification by the verifier, underwriter,
							credit committee, etc. It is important to note that there can be
							any number of such checks, until all the necessary data is
							received.
						</li>
						<li>
							Configuring continuous integration and service health to support
							data updating. .
						</li>
						<li>
							Development of methods to scale the product depending on the load,
							customer needs, and business requirements.
						</li>
						<li>
							Strengthening the resilience and fault tolerance of the platform.
						</li>
						<li>
							Creation of roles, separation of rights, powers, and access in the
							system.
						</li>
						<li>
							Implementation of additional modules and interfaces for
							integration with new business partners.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						But, since the service was created by other specialists, the
						BuildApps developers faced several difficulties and challenges.
					</p>
					<p>
						To quickly and efficiently manage the platform's architecture, it
						was necessary to understand the structure of services and
						algorithms. It requires an analysis of the technical documentation,
						which the past performers did not transfer to the client. As a
						result, the BuildApps developers had to figure out the architecture,
						code elements, and system dependencies on their own, which
						significantly extended the project closure period. Despite this, the
						team completed a huge list of tasks under a tight deadline.
					</p>
					<H4>Works that show the result:</H4>
					<p>BuildApps specialists have performed:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Transferring the service to a more convenient and customizable
							environment: initially, in the process of scaling — to a virtual
							server; after completion — to the client's local server.
						</li>
						<li>
							Building a micro-service and micro-front-end architecture, which
							made it possible to manage individual modules of the system more
							flexibly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Creation of a technical base, environment, and setting up
							processes for automatic testing of new modules and system
							algorithms.
						</li>
						<li>
							Adding an integration system and automatic uploading of
							information from available databases and registries about
							customers to optimize the costs of assessing their solvency.
						</li>
						<li>
							Separation of the roles of the financial company's employees in
							the system to obtain a clearer and more understandable
							distribution of powers and work with the client.
						</li>
						<li>
							Development of an automatic system for testing the platform's
							performance, identifying and recording information about failures
							and errors.
						</li>
						<li>Creation of a model for integration with partner services.</li>
						<li>
							Consolidation of all technical details on the platform into
							updated, detailed, and understandable documentation.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<H4>Really noticeable results</H4>
					<p>
						As a result of the comprehensive approach of BuildApps specialists
						to solving business problems of a financial company, the service has
						become simpler, clearer, and more productive. All applications are
						processed faster, and employees can automate and monitor loans. The
						quality of customer processing has also improved: thanks to clear
						and understandable information from up-to-date registers, the
						percentage of bad loans has decreased, which has increased the
						company's profitability. But the main thing is that thanks to
						integration with services for attracting potential customers and
						expanding the product line, the main goal has been achieved: an
						increase in the number of borrowers by more than 30%.
					</p>
					<p>
						Such productive and systematic work for 12 months by the BuildApps
						team really impressed the PapaFinance management, and now the
						company plans to expand the roles of employees in the company,
						integrate the service with other platforms and marketplaces, and
						form new financial products.
